## Usage

Before using the system, make sure you have a SQLite database set up. You can find the database connection setup in the `db.py` file.

You can interact with the system by importing the `Employee` class from `db.py` and perform various operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting employee records.

```python
from db import Employee

# Creating a new employee record
employee1 = Employee("John", "Doe", 30)
employee1.create()

# Retrieving an employee by ID
employee2 = Employee.get(1)

# Updating an existing employee record
employee2.age = 35
employee2.update()

# Deleting an employee record
employee2.delete(1)

# Listing employees based on certain criteria
employees_over_30 = Employee.get_list(age=30)
